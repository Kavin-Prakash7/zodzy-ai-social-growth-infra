# AI Parasitic Social Media Growth Infrastructure

> Developed for **GDG TechSprint Hackathon**

An AI-driven, non-invasive growth infrastructure designed to integrate into social media workflows.  
The system analyzes engagement signals, identifies performance patterns, and automates growth-related tasks while remaining platform-compliant.

---

## Overview

Most analytics tools focus on *what* happened (views, likes, reach).  
This system focuses on **why it happened**.

By decomposing content performance into clear behavioral and algorithmic signals, creators and teams gain actionable intelligence that can be executed immediately through AI-powered agents.

## Key Capabilities

- Engagement and performance signal analysis  
- AI-based pattern recognition and optimization  
- Automated execution of growth workflows  
- Continuous feedback-driven learning  
- Modular agent-based architecture

## System Architecture

### 1. Data Ingestion & Signal Collection

The foundation layer continuously gathers raw platform data and converts it into structured signals.

- **YouTube Info Collector**  
  Gathers complete video metadata including views, watch time, engagement, publish time, and channel context.

- **Like Scraper**  
  Calculates like-to-view ratios to measure genuine audience interest beyond surface-level views.

- **Duration Scraper**  
  Analyzes watch behavior to identify optimal video length for retention.

- **Favorite Scraper**  
  Detects long-term value by tracking save and revisit behavior.

- **Title Scraper**  
  Identifies high-performing title structures that drive clicks and trust.

- **Published-At Agent**  
  Determines optimal upload timing based on audience activity and algorithm response windows.

- **Tags Scraper**  
  Extracts and ranks effective tags to improve discoverability.

- **Comments Scraper**  
  Analyzes sentiment, emotion, and intent to understand audience reaction.

### 2. Intelligence & Pattern Recognition

Collected signals are processed into actionable insights.

- **24+T Review Agent**  
  Evaluates content performance after 24 hours to classify growth as accelerating, stagnating, or decaying.

- **Personalized Owner Chatbot**  
  Provides a conversational interface for querying performance insights, risks, and opportunities in real time.

### 3. Content & Communication Automation

Insights are directly converted into execution.

- **Script Writing Agent**  
  Generates optimized video scripts using retention patterns and audience tone.

- **Template Generation Agent**  
  Produces reusable content, outreach, and email templates aligned with proven structures.

- **Proposal Agent**  
  Automatically generates collaboration and brand proposals tailored to channel performance.

---

### 4. Business & Growth Expansion

The infrastructure extends beyond content into monetization and operations.

- **Lead Generation Agent**  
  Identifies relevant sponsors, partners, and collaboration opportunities.

- **Gmail Categorization Agent**  
  Classifies incoming emails by intent such as brand deals, collaborations, spam, or urgent messages.

- **Booking & Appointment Agent**  
  Manages meeting scheduling and follow-ups without manual intervention.
