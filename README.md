# AI Parasitic Social Media Growth Infrastructure

This project is developed as part of **GDG TechSprint Hackathon**.

## 📌 Overview
An AI-driven, non-invasive growth infrastructure that integrates into social media workflows to analyze engagement signals, optimize content strategies, and automate repetitive growth-related tasks while remaining platform-compliant.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Engagement and performance signal analysis  
- AI-based growth optimization  
- Automated workflow execution  
- Continuous feedback-driven learning  

Data Ingestion & Signal Collection (Foundation Layer)

The system begins by continuously collecting raw platform data.

YouTube Info Collector
Gathers complete video metadata including views, watch time, engagement, publish time, and channel context.

Like Scraper
Calculates like-to-view ratios to measure true audience interest beyond surface-level views.

Duration Scraper
Analyzes watch behavior to identify optimal video lengths that maximize retention and reach.

Favorite Scraper
Detects high-value content by tracking save and revisit behavior, indicating long-term interest.

Title Scraper
Identifies high-performing title structures that drive clicks and trust.

Published-At Agent
Determines optimal upload timing based on audience activity and algorithm response windows.

Tags Scraper
Extracts and ranks top-performing tags to improve discoverability and algorithm alignment.

Comments Scraper
Analyzes sentiment, emotion, and intent within comments to understand audience reaction.

2️⃣ Intelligence & Pattern Recognition

Once data is collected, agents convert signals into insights.

24+T Review Agent
Evaluates video growth after 24 hours to determine whether content is accelerating, stagnating, or decaying.

Personalized Owner Chatbot
Transforms all insights into a conversational interface, allowing creators or teams to ask real-time questions about performance, risks, and opportunities.


3️⃣ Content & Communication Automation 

Insights are immediately turned into execution.

Script Writing Agent
Generates optimized video scripts based on high-performing patterns, audience tone, and retention data.

Template Generation Agent
Creates reusable content, outreach, and email templates aligned with proven performance structures.

Proposal Agent
Automatically generates collaboration and brand proposals tailored to channel data and growth signals.

4️⃣ Business & Growth Expansion 

The system extends beyond content into monetization and partnerships.

Lead Generation Agent
Identifies relevant business leads, sponsors, and collaboration opportunities.

Gmail Categorization Agent
Automatically labels incoming emails by intent (brand deals, spam, collaborations, urgent).

Booking & Appointment Agent
Handles meeting scheduling and follow-ups without human involvement.



Agentic Dashboard Orchestration

What This System in Dashboard Does ?

This system breaks down content performance into clear, real-time signals that explain why something is working or not, instead of just showing views or likes.

Each signal answers one specific question about audience behavior or algorithm response.

1. Duration 

SWEETSPOT
Shows whether the content length is optimal for audience attention.

RETENTION
Measures how well viewers stay engaged throughout the content.

LIFT
Tracks improvement or drop in engagement compared to past content.

COMPLETION
Shows how many viewers finish the content fully.



2. Views 

VELOCITY
How fast views are increasing right now.

PULSE
The momentum of growth—whether views are accelerating or slowing.

DRIFT
Detects whether interest is fading over time.

REACH
How many new people the content is reaching.



3.  Publish Timing 

WINDOW
Identifies if the content was published at the right time.

HALFLIFE
How long the content stays relevant after publishing.

BOOST
Detects short-term algorithm promotion.

RHYTHM
Shows consistency and timing alignment with audience behavior.


4. Likes 

APPEAL
How attractive the content is at first glance.

LOYALTY
Whether the same audience keeps liking consistently.

AMPLIFY
How likely people are to support the content publicly.

SIGNAL
Overall strength of positive audience response.


5. Comments 

SPARK
How quickly conversations start.

ECHO
Whether discussions continue or die quickly.

PULL
How strongly the content invites opinions or responses.

HEAT
Intensity of audience reaction.



6. Title 

GRAB
Does the title catch attention immediately?

ALIGN
Does the title match the content expectations?

PULL
Does the title make people curious enough to click?

TRUST
Does the title feel honest and credible?



7. Thumbnail

HOOK
Does the thumbnail stop people from scrolling?

STORY
Does it visually explain the content?

CONTRAST
Does it stand out among other content?

SIGNAL
Overall effectiveness of the thumbnail.
