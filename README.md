AI Parasitic Social Media Growth Infrastructure

Developed for GDG TechSprint Hackathon

An AI-driven, non-invasive growth infrastructure designed to integrate into social media workflows.
The system analyzes engagement signals, identifies performance patterns, and automates growth-related tasks while remaining platform-compliant.

Overview

Most analytics tools focus on what happened (views, likes, reach).
This system focuses on why it happened.

By decomposing content performance into clear behavioral and algorithmic signals, creators and teams gain actionable intelligence that can be executed immediately through AI-powered agents.

Key Capabilities

📊 Engagement and performance signal analysis

🧠 AI-based pattern recognition and optimization

⚙️ Automated execution of growth workflows

🔁 Continuous feedback-driven learning

🧩 Modular agent-based architecture

System Architecture
1. Data Ingestion & Signal Collection

The foundation layer continuously gathers raw platform data and converts it into structured signals.

YouTube Info Collector
Collects video metadata including views, watch time, engagement, publish time, and channel context.

Like Scraper
Calculates like-to-view ratios to measure genuine audience interest.

Duration Scraper
Analyzes watch behavior to identify optimal video length for retention.

Favorite Scraper
Detects long-term value by tracking save and revisit behavior.

Title Scraper
Identifies high-performing title structures that drive clicks and trust.

Published-At Agent
Determines optimal upload timing based on audience activity and algorithm response windows.

Tags Scraper
Extracts and ranks effective tags to improve discoverability.

Comments Scraper
Analyzes sentiment, emotion, and intent to understand audience reaction.

2. Intelligence & Pattern Recognition

Collected signals are processed into actionable insights.

24+T Review Agent
Evaluates content performance after 24 hours to classify growth as accelerating, stagnating, or decaying.

Personalized Owner Chatbot
Provides a conversational interface for querying performance insights, risks, and opportunities in real time.

3. Content & Communication Automation

Insights are directly converted into execution.

Script Writing Agent
Generates optimized video scripts using retention patterns and audience tone.

Template Generation Agent
Produces reusable content, outreach, and email templates aligned with proven structures.

Proposal Agent
Automatically generates collaboration and brand proposals tailored to channel performance.

4. Business & Growth Expansion

The infrastructure extends beyond content into monetization and operations.

Lead Generation Agent
Identifies relevant sponsors, partners, and collaboration opportunities.

Gmail Categorization Agent
Classifies incoming emails by intent (brand deals, collaborations, spam, urgent).

Booking & Appointment Agent
Manages scheduling and follow-ups without manual intervention.

Agentic Dashboard Orchestration

The dashboard translates complex performance data into clear, real-time signals that explain audience behavior and algorithm response.
